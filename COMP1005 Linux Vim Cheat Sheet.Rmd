## Unix Help
* Help and information documents run a program called pager
  * You need to use key binding to move around pager documents
    * Move down: j, down, page down, enter, or space
    * Move up: k, up, or page up
    * Quit: q

| whereis *some_command* | Print the path to *some_command* and other paths significant to it |

## File System
* / is used to direct to a file
  * You will need to work your way down from the top (files are hierarchial), so it might be /topfile/middlefile/actualfile, etc. to be in the file you want
* To delete a file, you need to delete the file, and have no processes have a file descriptor for it
* . refers to the file you are in, and .. refers to the parent file (or file that file is in)

| *variable/file1* \< *variable/file2* | Execute *1*, but take input from *2* instead of terminal |

\newpage

## Bash Scripts
* **Note**: Spaces are important! Cannot have any extra white space
* Create with vim *filename*.sh - 
  .sh is the file type for all bash scripts (sh for shell)
* Run with sh *filename*.sh
* Uses the same language as terminal
* Needs to start with
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
```
* Can only comment with #
* Use command line arguments:
  * Don't need to download anything
  * In script set variables to be defined as \$*n*
    * \$1 - is the command to run the script
    * \$2 - onwards - is the arguments after 1, all separated with spaces
    * \$@ - is all command line arguments
* You can use command line functions in the script exactly as you would in the command line
  * Can use mkdir, cd, etc.
* echo is print, don't need brackets or anything, just not whatever separated with spaces
* Use functions with accents \`*function*\`
  * Range: \`seq *low* *step* *high*\`
  * Date: \`date "+%Y-%M-%d_%H:%M:%s"\`
* For loop:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
for item in $range
  do
    thing
  done
```
  
## Create a Package
* Modules are the programs containing functions
* Packages are the directory containing the modules
  * Makes a directory a package using:
    * \_\_init\_\_.py in the directory
  * Call as 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
import package.module
```

\newpage

### Creating a Global Package
* Add to PyPI to use with pip install
* PyPI - https:\/\/pypi.python.org/
* Need to consider structure
  * Need to use guides beyond PEP8
  * Eg. PEP257 - docstring conventions
* Package name constraints:
  * All lowercase
  * Unique on pypi, even if you don't want to make your package publicly available
  * Underscore-separated or no work separators at all (no hyphens)
* Directory structure
  * Top level directory is the root of the SCN repo, eg *package*.git
  * Sub-directory of the same name is the actual python module, holds:
    * \_\_init\_\_.py
    * setup.py -  
from setuptools import setup  
setup(name = '*package*',  
version = '*n*',  
description = '*string*',  
url = '*url*',  
author = '*me*',  
author_email = '*email*',  
license = 'MIT',  
packages = ['*package*'],  
zip_safe = False)
      * Then the package can be downloaded with pip locally
* To register the package to PyPI  
\$ python setup.py register
  * If you haven't registered anything before you will need an account
  * Then anyone can download it with pip, and it can be made a dependency of other packages, and be automatically installed when that package is installed
* Ignoring files
  * Don't want to include all files in the package (Eg. intermediaary files made automatically by Python during development)
  * Use .gitignore to automate (or equivalent for other SCM/VCS's)
    * Compiled Python modules:  
\*.pyc
    * Setuptools distribution folder:  
/dist/
    * Python egg metadata, regenerated from source by setuptools  
/\*.egg-info

\newpage

## Creating and Opening Zip Files
* Create the zip file:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
zip filename *
```
  * This creates a zip file containing everything in your current directory
* To save with a specific file name:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
zip -R chosenname 'nameofcurrentfile' *
```
* See the contents inside a zip file
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
unzip -1 filename.zip
```

## Accessing Jupyter Notebooks
* Type jupyter notebooks into terminal in the directory you want to work in
* Use control-c to close the jupyter notebooks

## Git Version Tracking
* Three trees of Git:
  * The HEAD - last commit snapshot, next parent
  * Index - Proposed next commit snapshot
  * Working directory - Sandbox
* Basic workflow:
  * Init a repo (possible init of clone)
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git init
```
  * Tell git who you are
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git config --global user.name "your name"  
$ git config --global user.email "your email"
```
  * Edit files
  * Stage the changes  
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git status
```
  * Review your changes  
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git add filename  
$ git status
```

\newpage

  * Commit the changes of directory with a comment  
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git commit -m "comment"
```
* Checking changes and history:
  * git diff - Show the difference between working directory and staged
  * git diff --cached - Show the difference between staged and the HEAD
  * git log - View history
* Using backups:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git checkout commithash
```
    * Commit hash is the first 4 numbers of commit when looking at the log
* Using remote repository:
  * Get changes
    * git fetch
    * git pull (fetches and merges)
  * Propagate changes
    * git push
  * Protocols
    * Local filesystem - (file:\/\/)
    * SSH - (ssh:\/\/)
    * HTTP - (http:\/\/ or https:\/\/)
    * Git protocol (git:\/\/)
